The canvas has a green border to help the user distinguish the canvas from the white background.
If the user does not click the "draw" button, the "move" button, or the "reset" button, the default mode is "reset".
In the "reset" mode, the user cannot draw anything.
If the user does not select the color option, the default drawing color is black.
To stop the object in the "move" mode, do not move the mouse when clicking.
