    <h2>One-sentence Introduction</h2>
    <p>Combining a resonant story and a simple way of interaction, Pilot Richard is a game that immerses the player in
        Richard’s life stage and encourages the player to help Richard pursue his dream.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/game overview.jpg" width="800" height="auto">
    </div>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The game is based on the real story of ground crew Richard, who dreamed of becoming a pilot but never really
        realized his dream. On the last day of his life, Richard sneaked into an airplane and flew the plane into the
        sky, using the skill he learned in a flight simulation game. After taking it for a 73-minute joy ride, Richard
        intentionally crashed the plane into a sparsely populated island.</p>

    <h2>Game Summary</h2>
    <p>As a young man, Richard Russell aspired to be a pilot and even began training for it. However, following a tragic
        accident involving a senior pilot trainee, his loved ones persuaded him to pursue a safer profession.
        Consequently, he spent many years as a ground crew member.</p>

    <p>Upon retirement, in a moment of impulse, Richard commandeers an aircraft and later crashes it into the ocean.
        Miraculously, he wakes up, only to find himself in his teenage years once more. In this new timeline, Richard is
        determined to chase his aviation dreams. Players are tasked with guiding Russell on this renewed journey to
        achieve his true passion.</p>

    <h2>Game Story</h2>
    <p>The game unfolds across four compelling chapters, each contributing to the intricate narrative. Chapter 0
        immerses players in the final day of Richard's life, where he clandestinely boards an airplane, taking off
        before steering it into the sea. Upon awakening, Richard discovers an unexpected twist – he has been transported
        back to his teenage years.</p>

    <p>Chapters 1 to 3 intricately delve into the pivotal three days that led Richard to relinquish his dream of
        becoming a pilot. Chapter 1 unfolds within the family dynamic, shedding light on the crucial moments with his
        parents. Chapter 2 explores a significant encounter with a girlfriend, while Chapter 3 delves into a pivotal
        scene with the Flight Camp Instructor. Through these chapters, players unravel the emotional complexities that
        shaped Richard's journey, providing a rich and engaging storytelling experience.</p>

    <h2>Game Play</h2>
    <p>In this first-person perspective game, each chapter unfolds within fixed game scenes. At the chapter's outset,
        players find Richard in a state of reality. They navigate the scene, exploring objects that trigger mini-games,
        each demanding completion for progression.</p>

    <p>During these mini-games, informative cutscenes unveil background details, providing a deeper understanding of
        Richard's story. Bravery Points serve as a guide, indicating the number of remaining mini-games. Once all points
        are collected, Richard transitions into an illusionary state.</p>

    <p>The illusion status vividly materializes Richard's painful memories. For example, vines invade and swallow the
        living room and Richard’s legs are twined by vines. Within this surreal setting, players encounter Richard's
        thoughts, emotions, and discouraging words from individuals like his parents in Chapter 1. Players must decide
        whether to persevere or compromise. Following the illusionary status, the chapter concludes, offering an
        immersive experience.</p>

    <h2>My Contribution</h2>

    <h3>Game Story</h3>
    <p>My passion for the airline industry allowed me to contribute significantly to Chapter 3 of the game. Drawing on
        my familiarity with flight details, I crafted an authentic narrative where Richard and his instructor face peril
        in the airplane. During the story revision, our group members discussed the motif of the game. I agree with the
        point that our game reflects the growth of Richard from a timid person to a determined person.</p>

    <h4>Game Feature and Game Detail</h4>
    <p>In the realm of game production, I took charge of both game features and details. Focusing on the flight
        experience, I incorporated elements learned from flight simulation games to enhance our project. Additionally, I
        designed the collection mechanism, stories behind each item, special scene objects, and Richard's monologues.
        The collection and its stories are rooted in my real-life experiences, modified and enriched with imaginative
        elements. Monologues draw inspiration from both my life and that of my friends, contributing to the vivid
        characterization of Richard.</p>
