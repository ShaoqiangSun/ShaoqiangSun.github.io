    <h1>The One-Sheet</h1>
    <h2>Light Travel</h2>

    <p><strong>VR/PC</strong><br>Target Age: 13-up<br>Intended ESRB Rating: E</p>
    <h2>Game Summary</h2>
    <p>In the future era, you are on a spaceship that travels in a galaxy. The galaxy has diverse planets as your
        departure and destination. Using the advanced technology, the spaceship can travel at the speed of light. Enjoy
        your extraordinary travel from one planet to another and explore the spectacular landscape of diverse planets!
    </p>
    <h2>Game Outline</h2>
    <p>The player can choose the departure planet and the destination planet. The travel time depends on the distance
        and the speed. In this galaxy, the distance between planets is enormous. To reduce the travel time, when the
        player departs from a planet, he or she should speed up. To land safely, when the player arrives at a planet, he
        or she should slow down. The speeding up process and the slowing down process require the player to press the
        speeding up key and slowing down key respectively. Due to the design of the spaceship, the frequency of speeding
        up should be slower and slower. Due to the safety issue, the frequency of slowing down should also be slower and
        slower. During the travel, the player can see the distance from the departure and the destination, and the
        travel speed. According to the physics theory, in light travel, the time flow is much slower than usual.
        Therefore, the landscape of the planet may have changed a lot when the player arrives.</p>
