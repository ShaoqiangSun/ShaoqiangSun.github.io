    <h1>The Adventure in the Cave</h1>
    <p>A team of geologists was exploring a remote, mountainous area that was barely inhabited. While walking through
        the rugged terrain for their research, they noticed a cave appearing in the distance. This was an exciting find
        in such a lonely and wild place, holding the promise of discoveries.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/1.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>As the team got closer, the entrance of the cave seemed bigger and more inviting. Curious about what was inside,
        they decided to go in and explore the cave's interior, ready to see what secrets it might hold.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/2.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>The cave's entrance was so large that sunlight streamed in, lighting up the inside. Inside, they saw rocks in all
        sorts of shapes and sizes and noticed bats fluttering overhead.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/3.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Moving deeper, the team noticed the cave began to slope downwards. With enough food and equipment on hand, they
        decided to continue their exploration, eager to see more of the cave's unique landscape.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/4.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>As the team ventured further into the cave, the natural light from the entrance faded away, giving way to
        darkness. They switched on their lights, illuminating their path. Drops of water trickled down from the rocks
        above, occasionally tapping on their helmets.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/5.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>The team started to hear the soft sound of flowing water. At first, they thought it might be a stream nearby that
        they hadn't noticed. They cautiously checked the ground around them, not wanting to accidentally step into the
        water. But, they couldn't find any stream. As they continued, the sound of flowing water grew louder.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/6.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Suddenly, the team had a worrying thought. What if it was raining outside, causing the cave to flood? They
        hurried back, trying to escape. But they found the path they came from was already flooded by heavy rain, with
        the water level still rising. The current was too strong to swim through. There was no way back.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/7.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Faced with no other choice, the team decided to go deeper into the cave, hoping to find another way out. As they
        moved further in, they reached a fork. To the left, the path appeared to go uphill, while the right path seemed
        to lead downwards.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/8.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Thinking the left path might lead to the surface, the team chose to go that way. After a while, they spotted a
        small light in the distance. Excited by this discovery, they quickened their pace towards the light.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/9.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>As they got closer, the light spot grew bigger until they could see it clearly – it was a hole leading outside.
        But when they reached it, they realized the hole was too small for a person to fit through.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/10_1.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Just then, they watched a bat fly out through the small hole. Looking through it, they could see heavy rain still
        pouring outside. This sight brought a wave of disappointment, but they didn't lose hope. They remembered there
        was another path in the fork they hadn't explored yet, which might offer a way out.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/11_1.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>After taking a short break, they headed back to the fork and began exploring the other path. As they delved
        deeper, the air grew colder and damper. They walked a long way in the darkness, relying solely on the light from
        their devices to guide them.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/12.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>After a lengthy walk, they noticed the light from their devices reflecting off something ahead. As they got
        closer, they realized it was a stone wall – a dead end. This discovery left them feeling completely hopeless.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/13.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>In frustration, one of the team members picked up a stone and threw it at the wall. The stone struck the wall and
        tumbled down. To their surprise, they heard a splash – there was a hidden pool of water they hadn't noticed
        before!</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/14.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Approaching the pool, they realized it was quite deep. One of the more experienced team members quickly placed a
        leaf on the surface of the water.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/15.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>

    <p>Observing closely, he noticed the leaf drifting forward. The water in the pool
        wasn't stagnant – it was flowing.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/16.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>This led him to suspect that the pool might be connected to a lake outside the cave.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/17.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Since all the team members were skilled swimmers, they decided to send one person to investigate. The chosen
        swimmer dove into the pool. For a while, there was no sign of them, which made everyone anxious. Then suddenly,
        the swimmer surfaced, excitedly shouting that they had seen light from above and the water was calm, with no
        fast currents or tricky terrain.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/18.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>This was fantastic news! Knowing it was their only chance to escape, the team decided to take the risk. They left
        all their heavy equipment behind and entered the water one by one.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/19.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/20.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/21.png" width="500" height="auto">
    </div>
    <p>Luckily, every member of the team successfully swam to the surface of the lake outside the cave. They all made it
        out safely, bringing their cave adventure to a fortunate end.</p>
