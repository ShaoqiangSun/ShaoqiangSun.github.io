        * NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words, you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part 4).


        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>In this project we have implemented part 1 Mirror and Glass Materials that are extension to the Diffuse material implemented in project 3-1, and part 4 Depth of field with the thin-lens model, which is an advanced version of the pinhole camera model implemented in project 3-1. In part 1 Mirror and Glass Materials we have implemented reflection, mirror material, refraction and glass material. We implemented the Mirror and Glass Materials according to the instruction, graph of refraction, and equations in part 1 specification. The problem we encountered is what pdf value to set in RefractionBSDF::sample_f function. We solved this by setting the pdf to 1 by reference to the pdf in MirrorBSDF::sample_f which is also 1. In part 4 Depth of field, we have implemented Generating Rays for a Thin Lens. We implemented Depth of field according to the graph of thin-lens model and the instructions in part 4 specification. The problem we encountered is that the image is blurred with the correct focal distance. We found that we didn’t perform the came-to-world conversion for the origin of the ray starting from pLens and then add the pos to the ray’s origin, but we had used pos as the ray’s origin. We solved this by computing c2w * pLens + pos as the ray’s origin. </p>

            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            For zero bounce illumination, the light reaches the camera without bouncing off anything in the scene. Therefore, the scene is black except the area light source.
            <br><br>
            For one bounce illumination, the light reaches the camera with one bounce of the objects in the scene. The specular highlights of the spheres are the results of the one bounce illumination. The light from the area light source has one bounce on the sphere and reaches the camera. 
            <br><br>
            For two bounce illumination, the light reaches the camera with two bounces of the objects in the scene. The light has one bounce on the scene and the other on the left sphere, and then reaches the camera. A small amount of light has one bounce on the scene and the other on the right sphere, and then reaches the camera. Therefore, the left sphere has reflection, and the right sphere has tiny reflection.
            <br><br>
            For three bounce illumination, the light reaches the camera with three bounces of the objects in the scene. The light has one bounce on the ceiling and two bounces on the left sphere (one bounce of entering and one bounce of exiting), which makes the ceiling on the left sphere has brightness. The light has one bounce on the wall and two bounces on the right sphere (one bounce of entering and one bounce of exiting), which makes the right spheres has refraction.
            <br><br>
            For four bounce illumination, the light reaches the camera with four bounces of the objects in the scene. The light has one bounce on the wall, two bounce on the right sphere (one bounce of entering and one bounce of exiting), one bounce on the left sphere and reaches the camera, which makes the right sphere in the reflection of the left sphere has brightness.  
            <br><br>
            For five bounce illumination, the light comes from the area light source have one more bounce compared to four bounce illumination. This will generate more possibilities of the path. The light transfer energy to more objects and more objects receive indirect illumination, which makes the scene looks brighter. 
            <br><br>
            For one hundred bounce illumination, the light comes from the area light source have nighty-five more bounces compared to five bounce illumination. This will generate more combinations of the path. However, the energy dissipates, so the contribution of higher bounces decreases exponentially, and the brightness of the scene will have an upper bound. Therefore, the scene is slightly brighter than that of the five-bounce illumination.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
        </b>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            For the pinhole camera model, everything is in focus. We shoot a ray from (0, 0, 0) towards some direction (X, Y, -1). The plane of focus is at z = -1. The point pFilm that receives radiance on the image plane is at (-X, -Y, 1). The ray from the plane of focus passes through the pinhole’s center and hits the image plane.
            <br><br>
            For a thin-lens camera model, objects are in focus only if they are within a plane that is at focal distance from the lens. Thin-lens camera model also has aperture that results in the depth of field. The point pFilm not only receives radiance from (0, 0, 0). It can also receive radiance from any point on the thin lens. We can uniformly sample the lens, which is an aperture of radius lensRadius, and we get sampled point pLens on the lens at (sx, sy, 0). The ray that passes through the thin lens’ center won’t change direction. And rays from the same point on the plane of focus will always be focused to the same point pFilm on the image plane, regardless of the path they pass through the lens.
