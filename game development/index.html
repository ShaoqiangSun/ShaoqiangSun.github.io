            <h1>VR Space Game</h1>
            <p>
                In this two-player game, a spaceship has been damaged by a meteorite and is now broken. 
            The player inside the spaceship must communicate with the player at the ground station to repair it. 
            Both players must rely on each other, sharing critical information to make progress in fixing the spaceship.

            The player aboard the spaceship uses a VR headset, while the ground station player interacts through a PC. I was responsible for developing the PC-side gameplay.

            <h1>Light and Shadow</h1>
            <p>
                In this four-player game, three players assume the roles of ghost babies (hiders) while one player takes on the role of the ghost mom (seeker). 
                The ghost babies are controlled using an Xbox controller, whereas the ghost mom is operated via an eye tracker.

                The objective for the ghost babies is to escape from the map through a gate. 
                To achieve this, they must step on a ground trigger that opens the gate. 
                However, the ghost mom can thwart their escape by gazing at a separate gaze trigger, which shuts down the gate. In addition, her primary method of capturing ghost babies is by casting a light on them with her gaze. Ghost babies can avoid detection by hiding behind obstacles scattered across the map. If a ghost baby is caught, it is sent back to the cemetery, which serves as the spawn point.

                I was responsible for programming the seeker’s gameplay mechanics as well as developing the user interface.

            <h1>Metro Core</h1>
            <p>
                In this VR game, the player uses a DV camera to uncover and document strange anomalies hidden throughout different levels. 
                To record a strange object, the player must aim the DV camera at it and keep it in focus for a certain period.
                The journey unfolds as the player travels by metro, disembarking at each station, which serves as a distinct level. 
                However, if the player fails to record all the strange objects before returning to the metro, the next station will mysteriously loop back to the previous one, trapping them in an eerie cycle.
                For this project, I was responsible for developing the water shader in Level 2 and implementing the black fog effect that shrouds both sides of the station, enhancing the game's atmospheric tension.

            <h1>Mouse Dishwashing Game</h1>
            <p>
                In this game, the player takes on the role of a mouse imprisoned by a cat. To regain freedom, the mouse must earn enough money—by scrubbing plates clean and delivering them on time. However, failing to send out a cleaned plate in time will result in a penalty, costing the mouse hard-earned money.
                Each plate contains two types of objects: stains and food. As the mouse tirelessly washes dishes, hunger gradually sets in. To replenish energy, he can eat the food left on the plates—but be careful! The cleaning tool might accidentally scrub away the food along with the stains.
                Adding to the challenge, the mouse's boss—the watchful cat—will occasionally inspect the dishwashing station. If the mouse gets caught slacking or making mistakes, the consequences are dire… he'll become the cat’s next meal, ending the game!
                Can you outsmart the cat, wash the dishes efficiently, and earn your way to freedom?

                For this game, I was responsible for implementing the random plate generation system, creating the stain and tool interactions, developing the UI system, and integrating the background music (BGM) to enhance the overall gameplay experience.

            <h1>Donkey Kong Remake</h1>
            <p>
                This game is a simplified remake of the classic game Donkey Kong. In this version, the player takes on the role of a dog whose goal is to avoid barrels thrown by a mischievous cat and reach the exit safely.

                If the dog is hit by a barrel, the game resets. If he successfully reaches the exit, the player wins. The dog can climb ladders to navigate the level—but beware! Barrels have a chance of rolling down the ladders as well, adding an extra layer of challenge.

                This was a solo project in which I was fully responsible for all the programming. The art assets were provided and not created by me.
