        <h1>Donkey Kong Remake</h1>
        <p>
            This game is a simplified remake of the classic game Donkey Kong. In this version, the player takes on the role of a dog whose goal is to avoid barrels thrown by a mischievous cat and reach the exit safely.

            If the dog is hit by a barrel, the game resets. If he successfully reaches the exit, the player wins. The dog can climb ladders to navigate the level—but beware! Barrels have a chance of rolling down the ladders as well, adding an extra layer of challenge.

            This was a solo project in which I was fully responsible for all the programming. The art assets were provided and not created by me.
