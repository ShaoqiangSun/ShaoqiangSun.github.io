        <h1>Light and Shadow</h1>
        <p>
            In this four-player game, three players assume the roles of ghost babies (hiders) while one player takes on the role of the ghost mom (seeker). 
            The ghost babies are controlled using an Xbox controller, whereas the ghost mom is operated via an eye tracker.

            The objective for the ghost babies is to escape from the map through a gate. 
            To achieve this, they must step on a ground trigger that opens the gate. 
            However, the ghost mom can thwart their escape by gazing at a separate gaze trigger, which shuts down the gate. In addition, her primary method of capturing ghost babies is by casting a light on them with her gaze. Ghost babies can avoid detection by hiding behind obstacles scattered across the map. If a ghost baby is caught, it is sent back to the cemetery, which serves as the spawn point.

            I was responsible for programming the seeker’s gameplay mechanics as well as developing the user interface.
